# Terminal-Chess-game-written-in-Java
A classic chess game played with Console Terminal, written in Java.
The pieces are represented with alphabets. because some terminal did not use UTF-8(so it will just print as "?" instead of chess characters). so it should run in any machines.

The representations are : K = king, Q=queen, R=Rock, B=Bishop, H=Knight, P=pawn. Upper case is for white and Lower case is for black.

To move your pieces, you need your origin position and target position. Eg : d8e5.

Some original chess features are not avaiable now, but soon i will work on it :)
